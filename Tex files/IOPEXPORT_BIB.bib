	abstract = {An analysis is given of the possible advantages of a photoelectron spectrometer based upon the properties of the axially symmetric inhomogeneous magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. The consequences of electron motion along the solenoid axis are discussed and it is shown that this can lead to a novel high-resolution method of electron energy analysis together with the possibility of photoelectron microscopy.}
